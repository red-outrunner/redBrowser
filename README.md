# ReD Browser 

Keeping it stack - this ain't your resource-hungry Chrome that be having your laptop sound like a jet engine. This that lightweight heat, built for the streets (and old laptops). 

## What's Good?

ReD Browser is that minimalist wave - a Python-built browser that:
- Runs smooth on them dusty laptops your school gave up on
- Got that clean UI without the extra nonsense
- Handles your bookmarks and history without eating your RAM
- Built different - focusing on speed over flashy features

## Why Though?

Look, not everybody got that M2 MacBook Pro sitting pretty. Some of us out here grinding on hardware that's seen better days. That's where ReD Browser comes in - letting you browse these modern sites without your computer having an existential crisis.

## Features üåä

- **Lightweight AF**: Your CPU can finally chill
- **Bookmark System**: Save your spots with that ‚≠ê button
- **History Tracking**: Keep tabs on where you been üìú
- **Clean Interface**: No bloat, just browsing
- **Auto-HTTPS**: Security on deck by default

## Get It Running

1. Clone this joint:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/red-browser.git
cd red-browser
```

2. Install the essentials:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Let it fly:
```bash
python browser.py
```

## System Requirements üíª

Keep it a buck - if your computer can run Python, it can probably run this. We tested this jawn on:
- That Windows 7 laptop you thought was done
- Linux setups running on prayer
- MacBooks that still got that Intel chip sweating
